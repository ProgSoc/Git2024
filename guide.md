## Projects

### ProgSoc Maps

* Brief: Surely we can do UTS Wayfinding but better, at least in parts.
* Stack:
    * HTML/CSS
    * Browser JS

### ProgComp FuzzJudge

* Brief: Compiling code on the server machine is tricky, and we can't support everyone's favourite niche languages - so let's make it about transforming the input into the correct output like Advent of Code.
* Stack:
    * Rust
    * HTML/CSS
    * Browser JS

### Timetable and Subject Planner

* Brief: UNSW DevSoc has Circles and Notangles, we should make that for UTS because myTimetable kinda sucks.
* Stack:
    * HTML/CSS
    * Browser JS
